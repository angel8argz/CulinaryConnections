# CulinaryConnections

DISCLAIMER: This is not a complete project. It is simply a concept that is supposed to communicate our vision in the creation of this app.

ADDITIONALLY: This is not the original repo. We are new to github and accidentally got of our ability to push on new files, and as such, we simply foudn it easier to create a new repo. The link to the old repo is here: https://github.com/angel8argz/CulinaryConnections-AppVersions

CulinaryConnections is an app meant to connect people through the power of sharing recipes. For many people, some of the best ways to connect with their family and their culture is via cooking and passing down recipes. For some, this type of connection may be difficult or impossible to achieve for a variety of reasons. 

CulinaryConnections has four primary pages: a home page, an explore page, a friends page, and a search page.

Home Page:
----------------
The home page serves as a hub for the user to upload a new recipe, look at recently uploaded posts, look at recently saved posts, access lessons, and look at their recipe book which contains all of their recipes. They would also have access to User Settings to edit their profile. We also want to implement a feature where a user can select several recipes and generate a shopping list based on the highlighted recipes.

Explore Page:
----------------
The explore page serves to present the user with different types of recipes based on different categories such as Trending, Easy Recipes, Mexican Cusine, etc. A user can quickly scroll through recipes and potentially find something that pqiues their interest.

Friends Page:
----------------
We want to allow the user to connect with their contacts and create new friends through the app. This is the primary feature of the app. In its complete form, the app would contain messaging features that allow users to connect with the chefs who created each recipe. This allows users to ask questions, and form meaningful connections via shared cuisine.

Search Page:
----------------
Our default search page will have recommendations for the user based on s=their activity as well as a brief history of the most recent searches. Inputting a term into the search bar will yield the most popular recipes. Users can see the images as well as an ingredients list and quickly look through recipes.

Overall, this project served as a great learning experience. Our team conjured an idea, designed an app, and developed a front end and back end for it. Although we were unable to get them to connect, we made great strides in fleshing out our concept which we believe has real potential to produce a meaningful tool.
